  path:
    description: 'A file, directory or wildcard pattern that describes what to upload'
    required: true
  if-no-files-found:
    description: >
      The desired behavior if no files are found using the provided path.

      Available Options:
        warn: Output a warning but do not fail the action
        error: Fail the action with an error message
        ignore: Do not output any warnings or errors, the action does not fail
    default: 'warn'
  retention-days:
    description: >
      Duration after which artifact will expire in days. 0 means using default retention.

      Minimum 1 day.
      Maximum 90 days unless changed from the repository settings page.
  compression-level:
    description: >
      The level of compression for Zlib to be applied to the artifact archive.
      The value can range from 0 to 9:
      - 0: No compression
      - 1: Best speed
      - 6: Default compression (same as GNU Gzip)
      - 9: Best compression
      Higher levels will result in better compression, but will take longer to complete.
      For large files that are not easily compressed, a value of 0 is recommended for significantly faster uploads.
    default: '6'
